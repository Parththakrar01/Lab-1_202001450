Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functional Requirements:

1) Sign-in/Sign-up: A user may or may not be a member of the Library Information System. The benefits of borrowing the book and extending the due date are enjoyed by the member. They must sign in using the necessary credentials for this. Additionally, there should be a sign-up option to establish a new account with premium if a user is not yet a member and wishes to join.

2) Borrow/Return book: A member can borrow a book of his choice if it is available. When a user clicks on a book, information on the current edition of that book should be displayed to the user, and they should be able to borrow it. The database will keep track of the date of the borrowing so that the user can find out when to return the book. The user will be penalised if the book is not returned by the deadline. In order to avoid overcharging the user, the feature for returning the book should also keep track of the date of return.

3) Add/Remove record: A librarian should be able to enter a new book's information into the database as soon as it comes into the library so that users can read it if they so want. Additionally, it's possible that the existing book is no longer available, in which case the librarian needs to delete it from the database.

4) Search: There should be a search feature for books that allows users to discover their preferred books by typing in the title, author, or publisher's name. Non-users should also have access to this functionality.

5) Extend the deadline: The member who borrowed the book should be able to extend the due date for its return if no other user wants that particular book. By extending the deadline, the user would avoid the lengthy procedure of returning the book and then borrowing it again.

6) Notify deadline: The user should automatically receive a reminder to return the book before the 24-hour deadline so they may do it in time to avoid being charged.

7) Notify arrivals: Regular users should be notified when new books are added so they may borrow them when they arrives.

Non-Functional Requirements:

1) Only the Institution LAN should have access to the Library Information System. Users from outside the institution should not be allowed accessed.

2) For security reasons, all confidential information should be kept in encrypted text form.

3) Server should be able to handle the large number of users for the better performance and the user's satisfaction.

4) The interface should be easy to use for better understanding.
